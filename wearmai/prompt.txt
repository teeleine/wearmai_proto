        ```text
        Hi Test User 2! Congratulations on committing to the Amsterdam Marathon. I’ve reviewed the biomechanics captured in your recent runs and your overall training history to date, and I’ve mapped out a 16-week, science-backed plan that should get you to the start line feeling strong, confident, and injury-free.

        Key takeaway
        You already run almost daily with balanced left/right mechanics and no glaring asymmetries, so we can focus on gradually adding volume, layering in goal-specific quality sessions, and protecting you from over-use with targeted strength work and a smart taper.

        ==================================================

        1. What the data tell us & why it matters
        (grounded in your metrics + established exercise-science principles)

        Stable hip–knee–ankle kinematics
        • Both hips flex ~13° on average and adduct ~–1.3°, with rotation essentially neutral (≈0°).
        • Knee flexion range (≈-40° mean, SD ~25°) sits in the “normal distance-runner” window.
        • Sub-talar (rear-foot) pronation angles ≈8–9° are moderate.
        ➡ Inference: Your stride is symmetrical and you’re not over-pronating or “collapsing” medially—a good sign for efficient, injury-resistant loading.

        Pelvic control is reasonable but not bullet-proof
        Mean pelvic list/tilt SD ~0.7-0.9° hints at small wobble. Evidence links excessive pelvic drop to hip-abductor weakness and over-use injuries; the randomized strength-training study on NYC marathoners showed targeted hip/core work reduced over-use injury incidence (Level-2 evidence).
        ➡ Strength and mobility sessions will stay in the plan twice weekly.

        Current running pattern = frequent, short (3-km) outings
        Your raw-run logs show 23 sessions over 23 days, mostly 3 km. That’s roughly 21 km/week—well below marathon-specific norms found in analyses of 92 sub-elite plans (median peak-week ≈ 65–90 km).
        ➡ We’ll expand weekly volume slowly (≈8-10 % per week) toward a ~55–60 km peak, consistent with “medium-volume” category in recent scientific surveys.

        Timeline & periodisation logic
        With 16 weeks, we can use four 4-week meso-cycles—a classic evidence-supported structure (Bompa, 1999; Matveyev, 1965; Schoenfeld et al., 2021):
        • General Build → Specific Marathon → Peak Conditioning → Taper.

        ==================================================

        2. Your 16-week marathon training blueprint
        (high-level overview; paces assume current easy pace ≈ 6:15–6:30 min/km—adjust if your GPS says otherwise)

        Wk	Focus & Volume	Key Runs (examples)	Strength / Mobility
        1-4 General Conditioning 32→40 km wk – aerobic base & form	• Long Run grows 12→18 km @ easy pace 
• 1 technique session/wk: 6×100 m strides + drills 
• All other runs conversational	2×/wk 30 min: hip abductor circuit, core planks, single-leg RDLs (50-60 % 1RM, 2–3×10–12) – aligns with “anatomical adaptation”	
        5-8 Specific Marathon 42→50 km wk – aerobic strength & LT	• Long Run 20→26 km (last 30 % @ marathon-goal pace) 
• Mid-week Tempo: 2×4 km @ ±15 s of goal pace 
• VO2 Session: 5×1 km @ 5 km pace (2′ jog)	Keep 2×/wk strength; raise load to 70–80 % 1RM, 6–8 reps hip thrusts/squats; add calf eccentrics.	
        9-12 Peak Conditioning 52→60 km wk – volume & race-specific fatigue	• Longest Runs 30 km (wk 10) & 32–34 km (wk 11) 
• Marathon-pace “Big Workout”: 3×5 km @ MP (1 km float) 
• Hill Repeats: 8×400 m uphill (strength + form)	Single heavy lower-body lift (80–85 % 1RM), plus plyo hops; drop to 1×/wk mobility during peak mileage.	
        13-14 Early Taper 48→40 km wk – sharpen & absorb	• Long Run 24 km then 18 km 
• Race-pace intervals: 2×6 km @ MP 
• 5-km parkrun time-trial (no heroics)	1 light session (band work, core), foam roll.	
        15-16 Peak/Taper 32→24 km wk – freshness	• Long Run 14 km (wk 15) 
• Race week: 2 × 5 km @ MP Mon/Tue, 20-min shake-out Fri 
• CARB LOAD + rest Sat	Body-weight activation only.	
        Mileage ramps <10 % most weeks; every 4th week falls ~20 % for recovery (consistent with “shock-recover” micro-cycle evidence).

        ==================================================

        3. Why each component is in there
        Long runs: Crucial for glycogen tolerance & connective-tissue robustness; evidence consistently shows a strong correlation between long-run volume and marathon performance (Hagan et al., 1981).
        Tempo/LT work: Improves lactate-turnover and marathon pace economy; meta-analyses highlight mixed-intensity plans outperform “all easy” mileage for trained runners.
        VO2 / hill sessions: Maintain neuromuscular power and running economy without excessive extra volume; also introduced when you’re freshest early in the micro-cycle (per Balyi’s “trainability” order).
        Strength training: Randomized trial in NYC marathoners cut over-use injury risk; core/hip stability also linked to reduced pelvic drop—your mild wobble should benefit.
        Taper: 2-3 week progressive volume cut (≈60 % peak to race) while maintaining intensity yields ~2-3 % performance boost on average (supported across endurance studies).
        ==================================================

        4. Practical weekly template (example: Week 7 – 46 km)
        Day	Session	Details
        Mon	Strength + 6 km recovery	AM 40 min gym (squats 4×8@70 %, side-plank, band walks). PM recovery jog 6 km.
        Tue	LT Tempo	2 km WU → 2×4 km @ MP-15 s → 2 km CD (14 km).
        Wed	Easy aerobic	8 km @ 6:20 min/km + mobility 15 min.
        Thu	VO2 hills	2 km WU → 8×400 m uphill (jog down) → 2 km CD (9 km total).
        Fri	Rest / stretch	—
        Sat	Long Run	22 km easy (last 6 km @ MP).
        Sun	Recovery + strides	5 km jog + 6×100 m strides.
        ==================================================

        5. Monitoring & adjustment
        • Effort: Keep most easy runs ≤ 2 / 10 RPE (≈ 70 % HRmax).
        • Sleep & HRV: Flag >10 % drop in HRV or persistent DOMS—scale back 20 % for 3 days.
        • Fuelling: Practice race-nutrition (30–60 g CHO hr⁻¹) on long runs ≥20 km.
        • Shoes: Rotate at least two pairs; replace ≤600 km.
        • Injury-signals: Aches lasting >48 h or altering gait → rest & consult.

        ==================================================

        6. Next steps & how I can help
        Confirm your realistic marathon-goal pace (current 10 km time × 4.75 ≈ target).
        Let me know any schedule constraints so we fine-tune the weekday ordering.
        Share feedback every 2-week micro-cycle—data-driven tweaks keep training “evidence-informed” (Schoenfeld et al., 2021).
        ==================================================
        You’ve got a solid biomechanical base and four months of structured, progressive work ahead. Follow the plan, listen to your body, and we’ll line you up in Amsterdam primed for a breakthrough performance. You’ve got this—let’s make the build-up enjoyable and rewarding!
